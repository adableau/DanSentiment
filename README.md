Danmaku Sentiment data
#Sentiment analysis in Danmaku-video interaction aims at measuring public mood in respect of the video, which is helpful for the potential applications in behavioral science.
Once these sentiments discovered, this feedback can help video creators improve the video quality and greatly enhance online users' watching experience.
To achieve fine-grained analysis on Danmaku-enabled videos,
we present and release a new Chinese movie review dataset,
consisting of two contemporary data types: comments and Danmaku
with annotated entity-level sentiment labels.
 These datasets provide a new perspective for entity-based sentiment classification, making the dataset ideal for exploring the interaction of sentiment classification on video comments.
